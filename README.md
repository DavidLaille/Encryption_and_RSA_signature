# Encryption_and_RSA_signature
A simple program to encrypt a file and decrypt it after

There is three java files in this repository:
- A file to generate RSA encryption keys, one private and one public, and to save it in two different files
- A file to cipher a file with the AES standard and then sign it with RSA public key
- A file to check the RSA signature and then decipher the encrypted file

I also put a pdf file which is a report of the work done, composed of the code and a view of the results on my computer
